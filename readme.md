# []memo

An interpreter that only performs what it can see. Code flows off the screen into oblivion.

## To Use

`memo.js` is the (non-minimized) production file.

## To Contribute

Please don't update `memo.js` or `memo.parser.js` directly. Update in src folder and then build with `grunt build`. 

PEG is optimized for PeggyJs. 

### Setting up the project

* Clone the <a href="https://github.com/rottytooth/esonatlangtools">esonatlangtools</a> to the `packages/esonatlangtools` folder.
* Run `npm install`
* If you're working on the web interface download the [Hack font](https://www.dafont.com/hack.font) to `/web/fonts`.
