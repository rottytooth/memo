# []memo

Long programs with short memory.

An interpreter that only performs what it can see. Code flows off the screen into oblivion.

## To Use

`memo.js` is the (non-minimized) production file.

## Contributors

Uses Peggyjs.

Don't update `memo.js` or `memo.parser.js` directly. Update in src folder and then build with `grunt build`.
