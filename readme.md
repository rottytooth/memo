# []memo

An interpreter that only performs what it can see. Code flows off the screen into oblivion.

## To Use

## Contributors

Uses Peggyjs. Web interface requires [Hack font](https://www.dafont.com/hack.font), not provided.

To contribute changes, don't update `memo.js` or `memo.parser.js` directly. Update in src folder and then build with `grunt build`.
