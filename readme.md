# []memo

An interpreter that only performs what it can see. Code flows off the screen into oblivion.

## To Use

`memo.js` is the (non-minimized) production file.

## To Contribute

Please don't update `memo.js` or `memo.parser.js` directly. Update in src folder and then build with `grunt build`. 

Requires the <a href="https://github.com/rottytooth/esonatlangtools">esonatlangtools</a> project deployed to the `packages/esonatlangtools` folder.

Also uses Peggyjs. Web interface requires [Hack font](https://www.dafont.com/hack.font).
